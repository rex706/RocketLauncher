 - Horizontal is when the screen is split by a horizontal line. Used with vertical monitor setup.
 - Vertical is when the screen is split by a vertical line. Used with regular horizontal monitor setups.

*Works best while both monitors are of the same resolution*

GUI can be skipped and run game automatically by creating a shortcut and using the parameters "-horizontal" or "-vertical"
