Latest version: 1.3.1
- now  correctly uses the smaller resolution if different ones are detected

1.3
- uses the smaller resolution if different ones are detected
- update tooltips for better explanation (hover over vertical or horizontal)

 - Horizontal is when the screen is split by a horizontal line. Used with vertical monitor setup.
 - Vertical is when the screen is split by a vertical line. Used with regular horizontal monitor setups.

*Works best while both monitors are of the same resolution!*

GUI can be skipped and run game automatically by creating a shortcut and using the parameters "-horizontal" or "-vertical"
